# tradingview-angular-example

[Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/) jsapi example in Angular base on fake data and fake websocket :smile:.

## How to run ([Or try the out-of-box way](https://github.com/forchartlib/tradingview-angular-example))
- Step 1

  Put `charting_library/` under the `src/assets/vendors/`
  
  **This repository doesn't have a tradingview `charting_library/` for some unknown reasons.
  If need, just create an issue and leave your email there for receiving the lib.
  Someone(NOT ME AT ALL!) will send `lib.zip` to you as soon.*

- Step 2

  Install dependencies `npm i`.

- Step 3

  Run `npm start` or `yarn start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
