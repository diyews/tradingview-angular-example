# tradingview-angular-example

[Tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/) jsapi example in Angular base on fake data and fake websocket :smile:.

See [Demo](https://tradingviewlib0.github.io/demo/).

## How to run ([Or try the out-of-box way](https://github.com/forchartlib/tradingview-angular-example))
- Step 1

  Put `charting_library/` under the `src/assets/vendors/`
  
  **This repository doesn't have a tradingview `charting_library/` for some unknown reasons.
  If need, see [repo](https://github.com/forchartlib/tradingview-angular-example/tree/chart-only). 
  Anyway, it's recommended to use your own `charting_library/` .*

- Step 2

  Install dependencies `npm i`.

- Step 3

  Run `npm start` or `yarn start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
